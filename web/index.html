<p><a href="https://192.168.1.57/index-ww2.html">Click here to be routed to a WeBWorK2 serve</a> that will render the exercises when "Activate"ed.  The server only has a root-signed server certificate (and no CA-signed certificate for now).  Click on "Proceed anyway" if you're willing to trust the server.</p>

<p>Alternatively, one may access the pages without a functional "Activate" button (i.e., without access to an online WeBWork2 server) through this <a href="https://justineuropt.github.io/ww2-collegeAlgebra-exers">web page (ww2-collegeAlgebra-exers)</a>.</p>
